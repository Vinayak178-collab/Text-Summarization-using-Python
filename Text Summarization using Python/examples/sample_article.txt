Text summarization is an important task in natural language processing. It helps users quickly understand large documents by producing concise summaries.
There are two main approaches: extractive methods, which select key sentences from the original text, and abstractive methods, which generate new sentences that capture the meaning of the source.
Modern systems often rely on transformer-based models such as BART, T5, or PEGASUS for high-quality abstractive summaries.
